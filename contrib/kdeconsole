Hi Tobias,

The new "konsole" application of KDE has the nice feature to have a background
picture behind the text. But as soon as a specific background color is set, it
is used instead. msged always sets a background color :-( 

So Ive done a few changes to it, based on msged_latest.tar.gz of May 2 1999.
It may be a stupid hack and its not fully tested - but it works here.

Sorry, no diff.


ansi.c:

"include main.h" seems not to work, so just add these lines:
 extern int cm[];
 #define TR_TRAN     38          /* transparent color */

In function TTScolor change:
        printf("%d;%dm", ansi_foreground_colors[Attr&0x7],
                   ansi_background_colors[(Attr >> 4) & 0x7]);
to:
    if ((Attr & 0xf0)!=cm[TR_TRAN])
            printf("%d;%dm", ansi_foreground_colors[Attr&0x7],
                   ansi_background_colors[(Attr >> 4) & 0x7]);
    else
        printf("%dm", ansi_foreground_colors[Attr&0x7]);


config.c:

Add a new "color" to "static char *cfgcolors[]":
    "ListSelect",
    "Transparent",
    NULL
 };


main.h:

Add the line:
 #define TR_TRAN     38          /* transparent color */

Add to "int cm[]":
    BLACK | _LGREY,              /* List selected text color */

    /* Transparent mask */
    -1                           /* nothing transparent by default */
/* This will not work if "int" is only 8 bits wide!!! */
};


Now you can say "Color Transparent Black _Black" to have transparent text. The
first "Black" ist ignored, but I didnt want to change too much in the code...
