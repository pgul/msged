@chapter An Overview on @value{MSGED} @value{VERSION}.

@value{MSGED} is a message reader and editor software for Fidonet (and
compatible) network(s), supporting Squish, Hudson and Fido *.MSG message
bases. This program is released to the public domain.  There are absolutely
no usage or distribution restrictions. This is truely free software.

@value{MSGED} emerged from MsgEd, a public domain fidonet message reader
initially written by Jim Nutt, and thereafter maintained by numerous people
(among them Paul Edwards, Andrew Clarke, and Kim Lykkegaard, who is currently
maintaing MsgEd). @value{MSGED} is being developed by Tobias Ernst. You can
reach me at 2:2476/418 or via e-mail at tobi@@bland.fido.de.

@value{MSGED} differs from the mainstream MsgEd in that it tries to support a
vast number of platforms by employing portable software design
techniques. It is my policy to release executables and source code at the
same time for all supported platforms, among them OS/2, Unix (Linux and
FreeBSD as well as commercial Unix systems), Windows NT and 16-bit DOS.

@value{MSGED} is developed with the GNU C compiler and GNU boundary checking,
which assures high program stability. @value{MSGED} also has some features
that the mainstream MsgEd currently has not, like full "seamless" internet
gateway support for Fidogate and simliar gateway programs.

In developing @value{MSGED}, I am in contact with the mainstream MsgEd
developer team, so most features they introduce will be migrated to
@value{MSGED}, and most features that I introduce in @value{MSGED} will
possibly also be migrated to the mains team MsgEd over time. There is no
"rivalry" between Kim and me, it is just that we have a little different
goals in mind and therefore decided to maintain separate streams of MsgEd.

Languages other than English often use special characters besides the normal
alphabet. Examples are the accented letters in French or the umlauts in
German. IBM block graphics are also called special characters. This section
will describe what measures have to be taken in order to be able to transmit
special characters via Fidonet.

@subsection Charset Kludges for the Impatient

The transmission of special characters is handled by FSC 0054 charset
kludges. If you do not want to work into the technical details and just want
to assure that your system complies to the standards, simply copy
@file{READMAPS.DAT} and @file{WRITMAPS.DAT} into the directory you are
starting @value{MSGED} from, put the following to the beginning of your
config file:

@example
OutputCharset IBMPC
AreaFileFlags 8
@end example

and stop reading :-). The following sections only explain the same matter in
more detail for the interested reader.

@node Problems with Special Characters, Special Characters in Fidonet, Charset Kludges for the Impatient, Special Characters
@subsection What is so special about special characters?

In order to be able to exchange text between computers, it was necessary to
agree on a scheme on how to encode letters into numbers, the so called
@dfn{character set}. The standard character set for transferring text between
a huge variety of computer systems is the ASCII character set. Unfortunately,
the ASCII character set is only 7 bit wide and does not leave room for
national special characters. 

In order to be able to transfer special characters like accents and umlauts,
it was therefore necessary to use eight bit wide extended character sets
that defines how special characters are encoded.

In contrast to the standard 7 bit ASCII character set, which is a single
character set used by nearly all computer systems, there exist several
pseudo-standard character sets that are 8 bits wide. All of them contain
ASCII as an subset, but they all differ in how they encode special
characters. DOS and OS/2 computers typically use the IBM PC character
set. Unix computers and the Amiga typically use the ISO8859 character set,
also known as Latin-1. Windows uses IBM PC for console applications, but
ISO8859 for graphical applications. The Macintosh uses the Macintosh
character set. The consequence of this is clear: If you write a text on a
Unix or Windows computer using special characters like accented letters or
umlauts, you cannot expect it to be properly displayed on a DOS or OS/2
computer, and vice versa, unless special measures are taken.

@node Special Characters in Fidonet, @value{MSGED} and Special Characters, Problems with Special Characters, Special Characters
@subsection How has this problem been solved in Fidonet?
This issue of special characters has been a problem for Fidonet in the past,
but it has been solved by the Fidonet standard FSC 0054, so that you can now
safely use special characters in Fidonet mail @emph{if} your message editor
supports FSC 0054. FSC 0054 basically works like this:

Every Fidonet editor that wants to be compatible with FSC 0054 must be
delivered along with built-in or external character translation tables that
tell the editor how it can convert text that contains special characters from
one character set to another.

When composing a message using a FSC 0054 compliant editor, you have two
choices: By default, the editor allows you to enter the full range of special
characters that your computer supports, but when saving the message, the
editor will use its character translation tables and convert your text into a
7 bit clean representation that can be displayed on @emph{all} computers even
if they don't support FSC 0054. For example, a German sharp s would be
converted into double s, an e with accent would be converted into an e
without accent, and so on. This is the maximum compatibility mode: It offers
you the comfort of being able to write text just as you would in a letter,
using all special characters that your language requries, but your mails
will still be properly displayed on all computers.

The other (better) possibility is that your editor leaves the special
characters that you typed in as is, but inserts a hidden kludge line, from
here on referred to as the @dfn{charset kludge}, into the message, that
designates which character set you have used for composing the message. When
your message is read on another computer by a Fidonet message reader that
also supports FSC 0054, the message reader will see the charset kludge in
your mail and then use its charset translation tables to convert your
message into the character set that this computer uses. The consequence is
that even if your computer and the computer of the receiver use different
character sets, everything that you typed in will look just the same on the
receiver's screen than on yours, including all special characters that have
been typed.

@node @value{MSGED} and Special Characters,  , Special Characters in Fidonet, Special Characters
@subsection How do I configure @value{MSGED} to support FSC 0054?
@value{MSGED} fully supports FSC 0054. The character set translation files
are named @file{READMAPS.DAT} and @file{WRITMAPS.DAT}. You can enable character
set translation support in @value{MSGED} by simply copying these files into
the directory from which @value{MSGED} is started. If the files can be found
and are valid, you will be notified that the FSC 0054 character set
translation engine has been activated. 

It is important that you use the correct @file{READMAPS.DAT} and
@file{WRITMAPS.DAT} files that have been shipped with the executable, because
these files are tailored to the charcter set that you are using locally: The
OS/2, DOS and Windows versions of @value{MSGED} ship with a pair of
@file{READMAPS.DAT} and @file{WRITMAPS.DAT} that is intend for use with
computers that use the IBMPC character set, while the Linux version ships
with a pair of @file{READMAPS.DAT} and @file{WRITMAPS.DAT} that are tailored
to computers that use the ISO 8859 character set (Latin-1). (Some Linux boxes
use IBMPC, codepage 437, or even 850, instead, but I strongly suggest that
you change your system configuration to use ISO 8859 in that case!).

The following table lists all level 2 character sets that @value{MSGED}
understands (meaning all character sets that are defined in the
@file{READMAPS.DAT} and @file{WRITMAPS.DAT} files):

@example
@@CHRS-Kludge: | Conventional Name:   | Used by these computers:
--------------+----------------------+---------------------------
IBMPC         | IBM PC, Codepage 437 | DOS, OS/2, Windows console
LATIN-1       | ISO 8859-1           | Unix, Amiga, Windows GUI
MAC           | MAC                  | Macintosh computers
@end example

These are the character sets that are used in the Western World. I would like
to also support the different Kyrillic and Slavic character sets, but do not
have any information on those. If you can supply me with more information,
please contact me!

Once FSC 0054 is activated, @value{MSGED} will be able to correctly display
all mails that have been created with one of the characters sets listed
above, as long as they contain the proper charset kludge
line. (Unfortunately, quite some still don't - do tell their authors to
correct their setup!). Mails that you write yourself may contain any
special characters, but @value{MSGED} will convert them into a 7 bit ASCII
character set when you save them.

If you want to retain special characters in your mail by adding a charset
kludge, you have to do two things. First, you have to define which character
set to use for saving your mails (it must not necessarily be the character
set that you are using locally). @xref{OutputCharset,,The
@code{OutputCharset} Keyword}, for information on how to do this. In most
cases, you will simply want to add the following line to your configuration
file:

@example
OutputCharset IBMPC
@end example

Then, you have to tell @value{MSGED} in which areas it is allowable to send
mails with special characters and charset kludges. @value{MSGED} will only
write special characters into areas that have the @samp{8} flag set. If you
are importing your message area configuration from a tosser configuration
file, you can simply put the following line to the beginning of your
configuration file:

@example
AreaFileFlags 8
@end example

(If you already have an @code{AreaFileFlags} statement, just add the @samp{8}
character to its parameters). @xref{Areafile and AreaFileFlags, The @code{AreaFileFlags}
Keyword}, for more information.

This will allow @value{MSGED} to use special characters in conjunction with a
charset kludge in all message areas imported from a tosser configuration
file.

If you only want to enable special characters for a few areas, you have to
define these areas manually, giving each of them the @samp{8} flag
individually. The same applies if you have to define your areas manually for
other reaseons. @xref{Manual Area Definition,,Manual Area Definition}, for
more information on this.

@section Internet Gateways - Using @value{MSGED} for e-mail and newsgroups

@value{MSGED} has built-in support for Fidonet to Internet Gateways, allowing
for seemless coexistence of Fidonet mail and Internet mail. When you use
@value{MSGED} to talk to your Internet gateway, you do not even have to know
about all the nasty details of gateway addressing - @value{MSGED} does the
job for you. This makes @value{MSGED} the ideal choice as an editor to give
to new users that want instant e-mail access without having to care for
klumsy gateway addressing rules.

@node Gateway Principles, Gateway Configuration, Internet Gateways, Internet Gateways
@subsection How to properly address an Internet Gateway
There are various ways of designing Fidonet to Internet gateways. The most
common is the @dfn{Gatebau} standard, which among others is
implemented in the excellent gateway software Fidogate by Martin Junius. You
can find more information about Fidogate at @url{http://www.fido.de}. Various
other gateway programs more or less conform to this standard as well.

Addressing a Gatebau compatible gateway works like this: The gateway has it's
own node- or point number. When you wish to write an e-mail using a standard
Fidonet editor, you have to adress your netmail to this gateway node
number. As receiver's name, you can use the real name of the receiver, or you
can use @samp{UUCP}, if the real name of the receiver is unknown. Some
not-so-smart gateway software requires that you always use @samp{UUCP} as
receiver's name. - In order to tell the gateway the e-mail address that the
mail should be delivered to, the very first line of your message must contain
the e-mail address of the receiver, preceded by @samp{To:}. The e-mail
address can be specified in three different forms. Here are three possible
first lines of gateway-addressed netmails:

@example
To: juser@@somedomain.com
To: juser@@somedomain.com (Joe User)
To: Joe User <juser@@somedomain.com>
@end example

The last of these forms is not supported by some older gateway
software. - The @samp{To:}-line must be followed by an empty line, and then you
can begin with your message text. A complete e-mail addressed to an internet
gateway at @samp{2:99/999.0} could look this:

@example
==========Message Header==================
From:    Bill Sysop, 2:99/123.0
To:      UUCP, 2:99/999.0
Subject: This is a test e-mail
==========Message Body====================
To: juser@@somedomain.com (Joe User)

Hello Joe!

This is a test.

Regards, 
Bill.
@end example

Receiving e-mail from the gateway is similar: You receive an e-mail from the
gateway node or point, and in the mail boday, the first line will contain a
@samp{From:}-line which designates the e-mail address the mail was
from. Sometins, the @samp{From:}-line is followed by a @samp{Reply-to:} line,
which indicates that the sender wishes to receive any answers at the e-mail
address shown in the @samp{Reply-to:}-line rather than at the e-mail address
shown in the @samp{From:}-line. Here is an example:

@example
==========Message Header========================
From:    Joe User, 2:99/999.0
To:      Bill Sysop, 2:99/123.0
Subject: Re: This is a test e-mail
==========Message Body==========================
From: Joe User <joe@@some-machine.somedomain.com>
Reply-To: Joe User <juser@@somedomain.com>

Hello Bill!

I received your test e-mail without problems.

Regards, 
Joe.
@end example

This interface works with every stone-age Fidonet editor, but it is
clumsy. When replying to an e-mail that came through a gateway, for example,
you would have to remember the sender's e-mail address, and when writing the
reply, you would have to manually insert a correct @samp{To:}-line, just to
name one problem.

Therefore, @value{MSGED} can do the work for you. If properly configured,
@value{MSGED} will to the job of interpreting and inserting @samp{From:},
@samp{Reply-To:} and @samp{To:} lines. With gateway support turned on,
writing an e-mail with @value{MSGED} is just as easy as writing a fidonet
netmail. In the following, we will see how to configure @value{MSGED} for
gateway support and how to use these features.

@node Gateway Configuration, Gateway Usage, Gateway Principles, Internet Gateways
@subsection How to configure @value{MSGED} to use an Internet Gateway
In order to do the gateway addressing stuff for you, @value{MSGED} needs to
know which gateway you wish to use for sending e-mail. @value{MSGED} will
recognise gated e-mail no matter which gate it comes from, but it knows which
gateway can be used to send replies and new e-mail, because most gateways
require that you pay some sort of registration fee before you can use them
for sending mail.

The @code{UUCP} keyword is used to tell @value{MSGED} the node number of your
internet gateway (@pxref{UUCP,,The @code{UUCP} Keyword}). It simply takes
this node numer as argument. Example:

@example
UUCP 242:4900/99.0
@end example

The @code{UucpName} keyword is used to tell @value{MSGED} the name that must
be in the receiver's name field in a netmail sent to the gateway. For older
gateways, you should use

@example
UucpName UUCP
@end example

If your gateway is running Fidogate or another more advanced gateway program,
you should use

@example
UucpName *
@end example

This enables real name mode, i.E., mail addressed to the gateway will have
the real name of the receiver in the receiver's name field instead of the
pseudo name @samp{UUCP}. The advantage of this is that your message templates
will generate strings like @samp{Hello Joe!} instead of @samp{Hello UUCP!}
@dots{}

There is yet another task to be done before you can use the gateway
addressing features of @value{MSGED}. For historical reasons, the gateway
addressing features are disabled by default, and you have to enable them on a
per-area basis.

Unless you have special needs, it is best to enable the gateway addressing
features for @emph{all} areas, because a lot of fidonet areas are gated to
internet somewhere. You do this by adding the @samp{u} flag to every area
that you have manually defined in the @value{MSGED} configuration file, and
by specifying @code{AreaFileFlags u} at the beginning of the configuration
file in order to set the @samp{u} flag for all area definitions that are
imported from your tosser configuration file. @xref{Area
Definitions,,Defining Message Areas}, for more information of message area
flags.

@node Gateway Usage,  , Gateway Configuration, Internet Gateways
@subsection Using Internet Gateays with @value{MSGED}
Once you have configured @value{MSGED} with the data of the gateways that you
wish to use and turned on the @samp{u} flag for all areas, writing e-mail is
very simple. When entereing a message, you just have to enter a valid e-mail
address instead of a user name. If @value{MSGED} recognises a valid e-mail
address, it will not look up this name in the nodelist or prompt you for a
node number, but it will automatically address the mail to the configured
gateway nodenumber and generate the necessary @samp{To:}-line. The
@samp{To:}-line will not even be shown to you, unless you have the
@code{ShowNotes} switch on (@pxref{List of Switches,,List of available
switches}).

Reading e-mail that comes from any intrenet gateway is equally simple. If the
@samp{u} flag is set for an area, @value{MSGED} will automatically recognise
@code{From:} and @code{Reply-To:} lines and hide them from you. Instead of
displaying the gateway pseudo user name and node numer, it will display 
the e-mail address that the mail is coming from in the message header field.

@value{MSGED} also supports newsgroups, i.E. echomail areas that are being
received from an internet gateway, as long as the @samp{u} flag ist turned on
for these areas.. In newsgroups, @value{MSGED} will handle mails (postings)
just as in netmail areas, i.E. it will display the sender's e-mail address in
the message header. If you do a private reply (i.E. a reply to a netmail area
using @key{Alt}-@key{N}), the e-mail reply will correctly be addressed to
your favorite internet gateway.

@item @key{Alt}-@key{X}
Quit @value{MSGED}

@item @key{*}

Scan all message areas for new messages. Depending on your setup, you will
have to do this on program startup. The scan process can be interrupted by
pressing @key{ESC}.

@item @key{#}
@itemx @key{Alt}-@key{S}
Scan message areas for new messages, but only scan areas that have not been
scanned perviously. Areas that have not yet been scanned for messages are
listed with dashes instead of message numbers in the area list.

@section Keyboard Commands and the internal Message Editor
@value{MSGED} has a built in message editor. It is suggested that, before you
start using an external editor for writing messages, you should at least try
to use the internal message editor, because it is best suited for composing
FTN-style messages. The internal message editor is highly configurable, so you
should be able to use the internal message editor with the same keyboard
setup as your preferred external text editor.

In the following, you will be shown a complete list of available message
editor functions. These functions are pre-bound to sensible keystrokes, which
are also listed in the following table. Each message editor function has a
unique name, and using this name, you can bind this function to any keystroke
that you might estimate to be adequate. Instructions on how to do this will
be given in the following section (@pxref{Redefining the Keyboard,,Redefining
the Keyboard bindings}).

@key{Ctrl}-@code{PgDn} keys and move the cursor to the top or bottom
line of the current screen.

@item Functions: @code{first}, @code{last}
@keindex first
@keindex last
These functions are pre-bound to the @key{Ctrl}-@key{Home} and
@key{Ctrl}-@code{End} keys and move the cursor to the very first or
very last line of the mail that is currently being edited.

@item Function: @code{tab}, pre-bound to: @key{Tab}
@keindex tab
This function move the cursor to the next tabulator position by inserting
whitespace characters (@emph{not} tabulator characters!) into the mail. The distance
between tabulator postitions can be adjusted with the @code{TabSize} keyword
in the configuration file (@pxref{Tabsize,,The @code{TabSize} Keyword}).

@item Function: @code{newline}, pre-bound to: @key{Enter}, @key{RET}
This function inserts a @emph{hard} carriage return and places the cursor to
the beginning of the next line. Note: Normally, hard carriage returns are
only inserted as paragraph delimiters or when posting formatted tables in
fidonet. For normal message text, you should @emph{not} press @key{Enter}
near the end of the line, but you should type a continous text (and leave the
wrapping to @value{MSGED}) and only press @key{Enter} once or twice at the
end of a paragraph. This will allow the receivers of your message to format
the message in a way that nicely fits their screen widths (not everybody is
using 80 column terminals!).

@section Redefining the Keyboard Bindings
@cindex keyboard bindings, redifining
@cindex redef

If you are dissatisfied with the default keyboard bindings, you can easily
change the keyboard layout. Each of the message reader and message editor
keyboard functions that have been listed on the previous pages can be
assigned an arbitrary keystroke using the @code{ReadKey} and @code{EditKey}
configuration keywords. The syntax of these commands is as follows:

@example
EditKey @var{keycode} @var{function-name}
ReadKey @var{keycode} @var{function-name}
@end example

The @var{keycode} parameter designates wich keystroke you want to
redefine. In order to find out the key code matching a certain keystroke,
invoke the executable of @value{MSGED} with the @samp{-k} option. You can
then press the desired keystroke, and @value{MSGED} will print out the key
code that you have to use as @var{keycode} parameter in the configuration
file. Here is an example session:

@example
[R:\mailer\msged]msgedp -k
Displaying keyboard scan codes in hexadecimal form.

Press any key or key combination, or 'q' (lowercase 'Q') to exit.
Key: 0x2100
Key: 0x0071 (q)
@end example

I pressed @key{Alt}-@key{F} and @kbd{q} to reproduce this
output. From the output, we can see that @key{Alt}-@key{F} has the
keycode @samp{0x2100}, and @kbd{q} has the keycode
@samp{0x0071}. Keycodes might vary depending on your hardware and operating
system.

Now that you know the proper keycode, you can assign it to any reader or
editor function. @xref{Reader Keystrokes,, Keyboard Commands and Functions in
Message Reading mode}, for a complete list of available keyboard functions
for message reading mode. @xref{Editor Keystrokes,, Keyboard Commands and
Functions in the internal Message Editor}, for a complete list of available
keyboard functions in the built-in message editor.

As an example, let us assign the keystroke
@key{Alt}-@key{F} to the @samp{wordright} editor function:

@example
EditKey 0x2100 wordright
@end example

With this line in your configuration file, you will be able to press
@key{Alt}-@key{F} in order to move the cursor to the beginning of the
next word.

@value{MSGED} has to be configured using a configuration file. This is a
plain text ASCII file containing a list of keywords, settings and switches
that define the behaviour of @value{MSGED}. The configuration file is named
@file{msged.cfg} and should normally be placed in the current working

This chapter describes the syntax of the configuration file and lists all
avilable keywords and switches in alphabetical order.

@end menu

@node Syntax, Keywords, Configuration Reference, Configuration Reference
@section Configuration File Syntax
Each line in the configuration file should start with a keyword. Each
keyword can be followed by one or more parameters.

Switches have a very easy semantics: A switch can be turned either on or
off. You can modify the state of a switch with the @code{switch}
keyword.
@c (@pxref{switch,,The @code{switch} Keyword}) FIXME
Switches really are just parameters to a special keyword.

When parsing the config file, everything that follows a semicolon until
the end of the current line is treated as a comment.

Within the configuration file, you may use environment
variables. Enclose the name of the environment variable within percent
signs. For example, if you give a command like @samp{"Areafile
%MAILBOX%\squish\squish.cfg"}, the string @samp{%MAILBOX%} would be
replaced with the value of the environment varaible @samp{MAILBOX}.

Aliases are used to simplify the entry of new messages. When you enter a new

all the other fields will be filled in with the values that you have provided
in the alias definition. You must at least specify the sysos`s @var{name} in
quotation marks and the corresponding FTN @var{address} in up to five
dimensions.

Alternatively, you may specify @samp{UUCP} as @var{address}. In this case,
the @var{name} field is interpreted as an internet e-mail address and the
mail is addressed to the corresponding gateway.

Optionally, you may also specify one or more message attributes and a message
@var{subject}. The @var{attribute} field is a combination of one or more of the
following letters:

@table @code
@item p

In Fidonet mail, mails that contain special characters must carray a charset
kludge line (@pxref{Special Characters,,Using Special Characters -
The FSC 0054 Charset Kludge}). However, still a good percentage of
fidonetmail contains special characters, but no charset kludge line.

By default, @value{MSGED} will replace all special characters with question
marks in mails without charset kludge, because @value{MSGED} does not know
how to properly translate such special characters. If you do not like this,
you can use the @code{AssumeCharset} keyword to specify that @value{MSGED}
should assume that all special characters in mails that do not contain a
charset kludge have been composed using the character set @var{charset}, and
translate the special characters accordingly.

In Germany, for example, nearly all mail that contains special characters but
does not contain a charset kludge has been composed using the IBMPC character

and operating systems that support it). On typical DOS-like consoles, the
cursor constis of 8 rows, labelled top-down from zero to seven. You can
specify a cursor start @var{row} and a cursor end @var{row}. The
@value{MSGED} default values of 6 (start) and 7 (end) result in a standard
"underline" cursor.

If you are using @value{MSGED} with a monochrome display adapter like MDA,
MGA or HGC, the cursor consists of 14 rows instead of 8. There, you will have
to use the @code{CurStart} and @code{CurEnd} keywords to produce a sensible
cursor shape. Values of 11 for start and 12 for end are suggested for mono
display adapters.

Messages sent with the destination domain equal to the domain of one of the
configured domain gates will always be sent to the domain gate with a @@DOMAIN
kludge inserted into the message.  To enable domain gateing, you must
configure all domain gates you are using in your config file by using a
@code{Domain} keyword with the full 5D address of the domain gateway
(including the domain that this gate is gating for) as @var{5d-address}
parameter for each domain gate. You also must have the @code{Gate} config
verb set to either @samp{both} or @samp{domains}. @xref{Gate,, The
@code{GAte} Keyword}, for more information.

With this done, Msged will gate any messages being written to disk with a
destination domain listed as one of the gates.  Note that for this to occur,
the destination domain must be different than your own.

Luckily enough, most users don't have to deal with domain gating @dots{}

Before you decide to use an external editor, you might first want to look at
the built-in editor of @value{MSGED}. Using the @code{EditKey} keyword, the
built-in editor is highly configurable to emulate the keystroke combination
that you are used to use from your preferred external editor, and you can

(The example from above will only look correct in the TeX (@file{.DVI} or
@file{.PS}) edition of this document. It should be an a dieresis, o dieresis,
u dieresis, A dieresis, O dieresis, U dieresis, and a sharp s in true 8 bit
special characters.)

This keyword is only relevant on UNIX. On UNIX, when using a VT100, xterm, or
similar terminal, @key{Alt} or @key{Meta} key combinations generate the same
key codes like national characters with ASCII values greater than 127. This
is a problem, because on the one hand, @value{MSGED} relies on combinations
of normal keys with Alt, but on the other hand, you probably want to use
national special characters in your mail.

By default, the UNIX version of @value{MSGED} enables all @key{Alt} key
combinations and disables all national special characters. You can then use
the @code{EnableSC} keyword to selectively enable national special
charcters. All special characters that occur in the @var{string} given as
argument will be interpreted as charcters rather then @key{Alt} key
combinations.

The example from above enables all German national charcters. The only
relevant @key{Alt} key combination that you will loose by enabling those
characters is @key{Alt}-@key{V} (``show notes''). This function is also
available by pressing @key{Alt}-@key{K} (``show kludges''), so that
isn't a problem.

Note that you will have to use an editor that allows the input of national
charcters in order to generate the necessary configuration file
entry. @code{vi} should be able to do this, as well as @code{joe}. If you are
not able to type those characters in VI, you should not even try to type them
in @value{MGSED} @dots{} ...

If you need information on how to set up a FreeBSD system to correctly

A function key macro is a predefined keystroke sequence that is assigned on a
function key. If you press this function key, @value{MSGED} will do exactly what it
would have done if you have typed in alle the keystrokes of this macro
manually.

The following function key numbers (to be used as the @var{number} parameter)
are available:

@table @code

Execute this macro at program startup.
@item 1 .. 10
@key{F1} .. @key{F10}

@key{Shift}-@key{F1} .. @key{Shift}-@key{F10}
@item 21 .. 30

@item 1 .. 10
@key{Alt}-@key{F1} .. @key{Alt}-@key{F10}
@end table

When using key scancodes in a macro, you must escape them with a backslash
character (@samp{\}).  If you wish to have this character appear in the text
of a message (or if it's needed as part of a path to a file), use two
backslash characters, like in the example above.

The example from above will assign @key{Shift}-@key{F1} to display a
pick list of the files in the @file{D:\TEXT} directory.  After the list is
displayed, you may select a file to import into a message while in Msged's
internal editor.  Note that control characters in a macro such as ^M

The @var{what} parameter to the @code{Gate} keyword specifies if
@value{MSGED} should do zone gating (@code{Gate Zones}), domain gating
(@code{Gate Domains}), or both (@code{Gate Both}). This has nothing to do
with internet gateways.

Domain gating is explained in detail in the section about the @code{Domain}
keyword (@pxref{Domain,,The @code{Domain} Keyword}).

Zone gating works like this: If you write a mail to a different zone and zone
gating is enabled, the mail will not be addressed to the receiver in the
other zone, but it will be adressed to that zone's zone gate (which also has an
address inside your own zone). The address of the true receiver will be
encoded in an @@INTL kludge line.

I strongly recommend to at least enable zone gating, because I found that it
is the only way to really reliable route inter-zone netmail. (In that point,
I object the original MsgEd documentation's author's opionion).

@end table

This command allows you to form groups of areas for which different
templates and user names are used. For example, you might wish to use a
different signoff in OS/2-related areas (probably stating your TeamOS/2
number) than in other areas. Or, if you are moderator in a certain area, you
might want to use the user name "Moderator" instead of the user name that you
are using in normal areas.

The @var{substring} parameter to the @code{Group} command specifies a
substring that must be present in the area tag in order to make the area a
member of this group.

The @code{name-index} parameter than specifies the index number of the user
name that should be used for all areas in this group. User names are counted
from zero upwards, so if you have to @code{Name} keywords in your config

In contrast to the @var{lastread-file} parameter of the @code{Name} keyword,

The @code{MaxX} and @code{MaxY} keywords are used to define the screen or
text window size @value{MSGED} is running in. Normally this will be
autodetected and @value{MSGED} will automatically use the full window
size. For example, on OS/2, you could execute @samp{MODE CO100,40} and then
start @value{MSGED}, and it will automatically use 100 columns and 40 rows.

In some cases, however, the autodetection fails, or you might not want
@value{MSGED} to use the full screen size. In this case, you have to define
the screen or window size manually with the @code{MaxX} and @code{MaxY}

can translate DOSish pathnames found in squish.cfg, fastecho.cfg or even
msged.cfg files that are mounted via NFS, rumba or smbfs from a DOS, OS/2 or
Windows machine.

Suppose you are having a message base that is stored in @samp{c:\msgbase} on
your OS/2 or Windows machine. Also suppose that your complete C: drive on the
OS/2 or Windows machine is mounted as /mnt/c on the UNIX machine. (The
Winodws machine and UNIX machine can be two distinct machines connected via
network, or a single machine with multi boot, where UNIX can mount the OS/2
or DOS partitions).

You can then install @value{MSGED} on the Unix machine and let it read in the
same configuration files that are also used on the OS/2 or Windows
machine. Simply put @code{MountDir /mnt/c c:\} into your configuration
file. When @value{MSGED} is running on OS/2 or Windows, it will ignore the
keyword, but when it is running on Unix, it will know how to translate the
DOS-like filenames found in the corresponding configuration files into file
names that are correct for the UNIX system.

You can specify your user name as the @var{name} parameter inside quotation
marks here. You can specify more than one user name by repeating the
@code{Name} keyword. Then, you can select which name to use during program
execution by pressing @key{CTRL}-@key{U}.

Optionally, you can use the @var{lastread-file} parameter to specify the name
of the file that stores the lastread pointers in Fido *.MSG areas. This one
should always be named @samp{LASTREAD}.

As a third parameter, you can specify a @var{user-offset} for each individual
name. The logic behind the user offset is as follows: Each distinct user of
your message base should have his own lastread pointer. All lastread pointers
are stored in a lastread file (@file{LASTREAD} for Fido *.MSG, @file{*.SQL}
for squish). Each user who wants to have a separate lastread pointer must have
a unique @dfn{user offset} into the lastread pointer file.

Normally, the sysop has a user offset of zero (which is the default for the
@var{user-offset} parameter), and each BBS user has his user number as user
offset. However, if you have two or more sysops (in this context, this simply
means persons accessing your message base directly with @value{MSGED} instead
of using the BBS), you must manually assign unique user offset numbers for
each person.

@value{MSGED} can use compiled version 7 nodelists to perform nodelist
lookups. With the @code{Nodelist} keyword, you specify the v7 nodelists that
@value{MSGED} should use. All three parameters are mandatory.

The @var{domain-name} parameter specifies the name of the domain, that is
used when picking which nodelist to use for address lookup if the zone number
is not unambiguous. The @var{base-name} parameter specifies the base name of
the index file minus the extension (e.g. @samp{nodex} for @samp{nodex.idx}),
and @var{sysop-file} is the name of the sysop lookup file. You must not
specify any path names for the latter two parameters - these files must
always reside in the directory pointed specified as argument to
@var{NodePath}. @xref{NodePath,,The @code{NodePath} keyword}, for more
information.

Normally, you will compile all raw nodelists that you have into a single

The origin line terminates an echomail and tells the sender`s FTN
address. Thus it has an important technical function. On the other hand, the
origin line also leaves space for about 55 bytes of free-form text. They can
be used to place your BBS system's name there, but you can also place other
meaningful or meaningless messages there. The text that you specify as the
@var{string} parameter may include whitespace characters. It will simply be
copied into the origin line, but be aware of the fact that @value{MSGED}
might have to truncate the text in order to prevent the origin line from
getting longer than 79 characters.

You can use macro tokens in the origin line to provide some sort of dynamic
information. The macros will be expanded to their value when the message is
saved. The following macros can be used:

@table @code

This keyword is used to configure the default @var{file-name} that should be
used for exporting mails as text by pressing @key{Alt}-@key{W}. You can
change this value at runtime; here, you just configure the default that the
dialog box will be filled in with. You can specify a normal file name, or you
can specify a special file name designating a device like for example
@samp{LPT1:}. On Unix, you can also a program that the text should be piped to.

The default format for exporting text is to write it in raw format, that is,
carriage returns will only be placed at the end of each paragraph, and no
message header will be added. This format is useful if you later wish to
re-import the text into @value{MSGED}, but it is not suitable for printing or
editing with "standard" text editors.

The default format can be changed by appending a suffix to the filename. If
you append the filename with @samp{,t}, like in the example above, a carriage
return will be placed after each line of text, and a message header will be
put in front of the text. This format is well suited for printing (use
@samp{lpt1:,t} to print the mail), or for using the mail in standard text
editors.

If you append @samp{,q} to the filename, the text will be exported in quote
format.  This means that an attribution line will be added to the beginning
of the message and each line will be preceded by the quote string.

Putting a @samp{+} in front of the filename will cause the text to be
appended to the file.  Otherwise the file will be overwritten.

Putting a @samp{|} in front of the filename will cause the filename to be
interpreted as an operating system command and the text will be piped to this
command. This only works on Unix and EMX-compiled OS/2.

Putting a @samp{?"} in front of the filename indicates you want to be asked
whether to append or not, and how to write out the file.  Some menus will
appear and you choose the action you want.

appended. This does only apply to areas which have the @samp{8} flag set,
because in all other areas, the messages will always be converted into a
7-bit ASCII representation.

The charset that you specify as @var{charset} argument must be a level 2
charset, and a matching translation table must be contained in the
@file{writmaps.dat} file. If there isn't such a table, you will only see this
from the fact that the written message will contain 8-bit characters, but no
charset kludge(!). So be careful to not misspell the option.  If you use the
@file{wrimaps.dat} that shipped with @value{MSGED}, you have the following
options:

@item Example:
@code{RobotName Areafix}
@end table

Using the @var{name} parameter of the @code{RobotName} keyword, you can
specify names of robot machines like Areafix, Allfix, VoteMgr and so on. Each
@code{RobotName} keyword only accepts a single @var{name} parameter, but you
may repat the @code{RobotName} keyword as often as necessary.

The reason for defining the names of common fidonet robots is the following:
When writing a mail that is addressed to a user name that matches one of the
defined robot names, @value{MSGED} will not insert the usual message
template. (VoteMgr will be confused if the first line in your Message is
"Hello VoteMgr" instead of the expected meta command @dots{}).

This configures @value{MSGED} to replace the "soft carriage return" character
(0x8d) with the @var{character} specified as argument to the
@code{SoftCrXlat} keyword when you compose a message or import a file into
the internal editor.  @var{character} specifies the ASCII character with
which to replace, and should be a numeric value between 1 and 255
(decimal). For example, CodePage 866 (Russian) uses SoftCR as letter "H", so
Russian users should define: @samp{SoftCrXlat 0x48}.

Normally, @value{MSGED} displays all message areas in the order in that they
have been defined in the configuration file and/or in the area
files.

With the @code{SortAreas} keyword, you can instruct @value{MSGED} to sort the
areas by certain criteria. The @var{criteria} parameter is a string that
consists of letters each specifying a sort criterium. The leftmost letter is
the most significant. The following letters can be used to define sorting
criteria:

@table @code
@item N
Sort netmail areas on top, then local areas, then echomail areas.
@item T
Sort by area tag.
@item D
Sort by area description.
@item G
Sort by Fastecho group number.
@end table

The meanings of @samp{D} and @samp{T} may vary depending on which area file
you imported the area from.  T is the true area tag, while D is what you
actually see on screen.  You will usually wish to use D, because ordering by
what you see seems to be more logical than ordering by what you don't see.

The @samp{G} criterium does only work with areas imported from a
@file{Fastecho.cfg} files. All other areas have a group value of 0.

The fido user list file is a text file that contains all fidonet sysop names
and the corresponding node numbers. It is used for looking up node numbers by
sysop name. A fido user list file is typically named @file{fidouser.lst}. You
can specify up to two fido user list files by repeating the @code{UserList}
keyword.

Note that even when you are using a version 7 lookup, it is still preferable
to also have a @file{fidouser.lst} file and to use the @code{UserList}
keyword, because only the fidouser list file lookup routines of @value{MSGED}
can deal with multiple matching node numbers for one sysop name (they will
present you a list to select from), while the V7 lookup routines currently
cannot do this.

The exact format of a fido user list file is as follows: Each line in this
file must have eactly the same length. Sysop names are left justified and
node numbers are right justified. Node Numbers must come after column 40. The
file must be sorted alphabetically in a way like the C @code{strcmp()}
function would do it.

Some Internet gateway software requires that mail addressed to the gateway
must be addressed to a specific user name in order to be gated into the
Internet. This specific user name is usually @samp{UUCP}, and you can specify
it as the @var{name} parameter to the @code{UUCP} keyword.

If your gateway is using a better gateway software, like Fidogate, it will
not have this restriction. Instead, such gateway software uses the name
fields in the FTN header to exchange real name information. In this case, you
should specify @samp{UucpName *}, which tells @value{MSGED} that the gateway
software allows any name to be put into the FTN header field.

@findex Switch

To turn a switch on or off, you can use the @code{Switch} keyword, which has
the following syntax:

@example
Switch @var{switch-name} On
Switch @var{switch-name} Off
@end example

The @var{switch-name} parameter must be the name of a valid switch (a
complete list of switches follows below. The first line from above turns the
selected switch on, the second turns it off. (You knew it before, did you?
<g>).

For example, in order to turn the @code{SEEN-BYs} switch on, you would add
the following line to your configuration file:

@example
Switch SEEN-BYs On
@end example

@node List of Switches,  , How to use Switches, Switches
@subsection List of Available Switches

The following switches are available:

@table @code
@item ChopQuote
@findex ChopQuote
When set to on, and you are quoting a message for reply, this switch will
cause all quoted lines at the end of the message to be removed (chopped) when
the message is saved.  This works only when using the internal editor. If you
are using an external editor, ChopQuote has no effect.  When set to off, all
quoted lines are saved, regardless of their location in the message.  Note
that you can also manually chop quotes by pressing
@key{Alt}-@key{L}. Default: Off.

@item Confirm
@findex Confirm
@cindex confirmations
By disabling this switch, you will put @value{MSGED} into the ``You asked for
it, you got it!''-mode, that is, you will disable any kind of confirmation
dialog boxes on critical actions like deleting messages, aborting message
entry, and the like. Default: On. (That is, by default, @value{MSGED}
@emph{will} display confirmation requests).

@item DateArvd
@findex DateArvd
If this switch is set to on, the date/time when a message
arrived on your system will be displayed on the right side of the
header information block below the date written information. You might want
to turn this off if your tosser should not fill in this date field
correctly. Default: On.

@item HardQuote
@findex HardQuote
When switched on, this option causes the column formatting to be preserved
when quoting, ie it doesn't reformat quotes. Default: On.

@item MSGIDs
@findex MSGIDs
MSGIDs are used to uniquely identify a message coming from your system.
Unfortunately no two message editors use the same MSGID-generating algorithm,
so you cannot guarantee that you conform to the MSGID specs unless you have
used a specific message editor (only) for a particular address in a 3-year
period.  Most people just ignore this potential problem and use them anyway.
Leaving MSGIDs ON will help mail tossers in duplicate message checking and/or
reply linking. Default: On.

@item OpusDate
@findex OpusDate
The old MsgEd documentation states differently, but judging from the source
code, turning this flag @emph{on} would @emph{stop} @value{MSGED} from
@emph{reading} the Opus date_written and date_arrived date fields of Fido
*.MSG messages. @value{MSGED} will, however, always fill in those fields (in
the worst case with the current timestamp). Probably you should leave this
flag as is. Default: Off.

@item QQuotes
@findex QQuotes
This switch controls how @value{MSGED} will modify the quote string when
quoting text that already is quoted. When turned on, @value{MSGED} will try
to add another @samp{>} character to the existing quote strings. If turned
off, @value{MSGED} will not modify existing quote strings and thus behave
much like Maximus 2.0 or TimEd do. Default: On.

@item RawCC
@findex RawCC
@cindex carbon copies, saving the raw original message
This switch is only of relevance if the @code{SaveCC} switch is turned on.
Then, if @code{RawCC} is ON, the raw cc:  msg is saved (along with the cc:
header that you typed in, so that if you re-edit the message, also all carbon
copies will be re-generated). Otherwise, the first formatted cc:  will NOT be
marked kill/sent and will therefore remain as a future reference, but the
original raw message will not be saved. Default: On.

@item SaveCC
@cindex SaveCC
@cindex carbon copies, saving the original message
When generating carbon copies, and if this switch is turned on, a duplicate
of the original message is saved with no kill/sent flag set for future
reference, and possible re-editing and/or resending (along with the normal
copied messages that are sent out and flagged kill/sent). Default: On.

@item Seen-Bys
@cindex Seen-Bysb
@findex SEEN-BY lines, showing
If this switch is turned on, @value{MSGED} will display SEEN-BY lines in
message reading mode. This is probably only useful for echomail routing
debugging purposes. Default: Off.

@item ShowAddr
@cindex ShowAddr
If this switch is enabled, the FTN address that you are currently using for
the current area will be displayed on the left-hand side of the line that
separates the message header from the message text. Default: On.

@item ShowCR
@cindex ShowCR
If turned on, @value{MSGED} will mark the location of hard carriage
returns with ASCII code 20, as known from common word processors. This might
not work on a VT100 terminal. Default: Off.

@item ShowEOL
@cindex ShowEOL
If turned on, @value{MSGED} will mark the location of each end-of-line
character with ASCII code 29. This will only work if the @code{ShowCR} switch
is also turned on. Default: Off.

@item ShowNotes
@findex ShowNotes
@cindex kludge lines, displaying
@cindex notes, displaying
If turned on, @value{MSGED} will display kludge line information in message
reading mode. You can also toogle this switch during program execution by
pressing @key{Alt}-@key{V}. Unlike in older MsgEd versions, this switch
does not pertain to origin and/or tear lines. Default: Off.

@item SquishLock
@findex SquishLock
@cindex locking the message base, for performance reasons
@cindex message base locking, for performance reasons
If the @code{SquishLock} switch is turned on, @value{MSGED} will lock every
message area that is entered (and of course unlock it when it is left), thus
effectively denying access to this area to any other program. This will
result in a considerable speed increase when browsing message areas, but it
has the drawback that the tosser will not be able to toss to an message area
as long as it is open in @value{MSGED}. So if you are accustomed to leaving
@value{MSGED} open even when going away, you should better leave this switch
off.

Note that this switch has nothing to do with data integrity concerns. MsgEd
will of course lock the Squish Message Base when writing a message in order
to insure data integrity even if the SquishLock switch is turned off.

The default value of the SquishLock switch is Off (in contrast to the
mainstream MsgEd 4.30, where it is turned on by default).

@item UseLastr
@findex UseLastr
You should leave this switch turned on. It instructs @value{MSGED} to use the
lastread pointer for Fido *.MSG style areas. On the other hand, turning this
switch off probably does not disable @emph{all} lastread pointer handling
code in @value{MSGED} @dots{} Older @value{MSGED} versions had this switch
turned off by default and it was undocumented. Hence a lot of problems with
lastread pointers in those versions @dots{} Default: On.

@node Area Definitions,  , Switches, Configuration Reference
@section Defining Message Areas
@cindex definining message areas
@cindex message area definition
@cindex area definition

One of the most important tasks in configuring @value{MSGED} is to tell it
where it can find the message areas that you wish to read and to write
to. There are basically two ways to do this: You can either manually define
each area in the configuration file using the @code{Quick}, @code{Fido} and
@code{Squish} keyword, or you can tell @value{MSGED} to read in the
configuration file of your tosser. The latter method saves you much work, but
sometimes you will ned to use the manual method to do some fine-tuning.

It is advisable to put all keywords that have to do with area configuration
at the end of your configuration file, because other keywords (like
@code{QuickBbsPath}, @code{MountDir}, et. al.) that change the behaviour of
the area definition keywords will only work if they are read in before the
area definition keywords.

@node Manual Area Definition, Areafile Parsing, Area Definitions, Area Definitions
@subsection Manual Area Definition
@findex Squish
@findex Quick
@findex Fido

You can manually define a message area by putting a line of the following
format into your confgiuration file:

@example
@var{format} @var{flags} "@var{description}" @var{path} @var{areatag} [@var{address}]
@end example

Except for the @var{address} parameter, all parameters are mandatory. The
meaning of these parameters is as follows:

@table @var
@item format
The @var{format} parameter tells the message base format this message area is
held in. It can be either @samp{Fido}, designating a message area in Fido
*.MSG file format, @samp{Quick}, desingating a message area held in a
QuickBBS or Hudson Message Base, or @samp{Squish}, designating a message area
in the Squish format.

@item flags
The @var{flags} parameter is a sequence of characters where each character is
a flag that toogles a certain option. The following flags can be used:

@enumerate
@item
Flags that specify the message area type. You have to use exactly one of
those:

@format
@code{n} - netmail area,
@code{e} - echomail area,
@code{l} - local mail area.
@end format

@item
Flags that toogle certain special features of @value{MSGED}. All of these
flags are optional.
@c FIXME add xref to documentation of these features

@format
@code{8} - allow 8 bit characters with the proper @code{@@CHRS} kludge,
@code{u} - enable internet gateway support for this area,
@code{n} - this flag is obsolete.
@end format

@item
Default message attributes for messages written in this area. You should
specify @samp{p} for netmail areas. The @samp{loc} flag will always be set,
so you can't specify it here.

@format
@code{p} - private,
@code{h} - hold,
@code{k} - kill/sent,
@code{d} - direct.
@end format

@end enumerate

@item description
The @var{description} parameter specifies the name under which the area will
appear in the area selection screen. It may contain white spaces if you place
it between quotation marks.

@item path
The @var{path} parameter gives the location of the message area. For Fido *.MSG
areas, this is the path name of the corresponding directory. For QuickBBS
areas, it is the area number. For Squish areas, it is the base name of the
area files without extension.

@item areatag
The @var{areatag} parameter gives the official area tag of this area. You
@emph{must} specify this parameter for echomail areas, and you @emph{must
not} specify this for netmail areas!

@item address
Finally, the @var{address} parameter specifies the FTN address to use for
this area. You must use this for othernet areas where you must use an AKA
different to your main AKA.

@end table

Here are some examples:

@example

@node Areafile Parsing,  , Manual Area Definition, Area Definitions
@subsection Reading a Tosser Configuration File (Areafile)
@findex Areafile
@cindex tosser configuration, parsing
@cindex area file, of tosser

This keyword is used to tell @value{MSGED} to read information about netmail
and echomail areas from a tosser configuration file. This saves you from
double work: You only have to declare an area once in the tosser
configuration file, and MsgEd will automatically always display all areas
that are configured in your tosser configuration file. The syntax is as
follows:

@example
@code{Areafile @var{type} @var{filename}}
@end example

The @var{type} parameter designates the type of tosser configuration file to
use. It can be @samp{Squish}, @samp{Fastecho} or @samp{AreasBBS}. The
@var{filename} parameter specifies the path and file name of the tosser
configuration file that should be read. (Plase note that only the area
definitions from a Squish configuration file will be read. If the Squish
configuration file references another @file{areas.bbs} file, you have to
define it separately for @value{MSGED} using a second @code{Areafile}
statement).

There is one problem with reading in echo definitions from tosser
configuration files: Those files do not contain all information that can be
specified in a manual area configuration, Certain features of MsgEd TE need a
flag that has to be set for each area in order to enable that feature.  For
example, in order to be able to write mails with umlauts, you must set the 8
flag for each area that should have umlauts.

@findex AreaFileFlags
Therefore, the @code{AreaFileFlags} keyword has been introduced. It's syntax
is as follows:

@example
AreaFileFlags @var{flags}
@end example

The @var{flags} parameter has the same syntax as the @var{flags} parameter of
the @code{Fido}, @code{Quick} and @code{Squish} keywords (@pxref{Manual Area
Definition,,Manual Area Definition}). You must specify the
@code{AreaFileFlags} keyword before the @code{AreaFile} keywords. Then, all
areas imported from the area files will have the specified @var{flags}.

If you want only a few, but not all areas form an areafile to have some
flags, you can manually redefine areas with the syntax described in the
preceding section. For this to work, the manual redefinition must come
@emph{after} the @code{AreaFile} keyword. Vice versa, if you want almost all
areas from an areafile to have a certain flag, but want a few exemptions, you
should use the @code{AreaFileFlags} and @code{AreaFile} keywords to import
all areas from the areafile with the specific flag set. After that, you can
redefine some areas manually without this flag.

Note: Using @code{AreaFileFlags} to globally turn on the @samp{u} flag
probably won't hurt you. On the other hand, you should only use
@code{AreaFileFlags} to globally turn on the @samp{8} flag if you know that
the moderators of the echo areas that you are posting in do not forbid
8-bit-codes.
