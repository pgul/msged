TODO-List for Msged
===================

Category 1: Will certainly be implemented until next release
============================================================

- Debug "Switch Statbar Off" (MMC)

- Debug Sascha Sible's Lastread problem

- Header recoding for Message List

- Add more cyrillic konversion tables (i.E. transcription to ASCII)

- Give the user the possibilty to only include the Areatag, but not
  the Fastecho echo description into the area list (Ralf Hoerner)

- Write a tool that generates a FIDOUSER.LST for the Userlist feature.

- Background attribute "transparent", vor the new kconsole feature
  (background images). Use patch that has already been submitted.

Category 2: Might be implemented, but volunteers are always very welcome!
=========================================================================

- Echotoss log is not updated for forwarded messages.

- Work on the area lister. Things to do:
  - Divide message areas into groups.
  - Show all groups with separators in between
  - Only show selected groups
  - New sort cireteria: numer of messages, number of new messages, number
    of personal messages, number of tagged messages, area tag (instead of
    area description?)
  - Online switiching of sort mode

- Figure out Squish's "last scanned" behaviour

- Rewrite the V7 nodelist lookup code.

- Place file requests directly into Binkley outbound

- Secure mode. In this mode, Msged itself has full access to the message
  base, but only allows the user to do secure tings. I.E. a user may only
  delete his privat messages and echomail written by him that is not yet
  exported. He may not do import/export, shell to OS, or similar. In this
  mode, Msged can be used as a mail reader in a BBS, possibly running
  "setgid fido", even when the SMAPI does not have security features built
  in.

Category 3: Will only be included if volunteers send patches
============================================================

- Windows NT mouse support. Linux mouse support. Mouse support in places
  where it isn't implemented currently (like file dialog boxes)

Category 4: Will not be implemented
===================================
