The subdirectories of this directory contain character set translation tables
that enable FSC 0054 CHRS support for MsgEd TE.

For the DOS, OS/2 and Windows versions, simply copy the "readmaps.dat" and
"writmaps.dat" file from the "ibmpc" subdirectory into the path where the
MsgEd TE executable resides.

If your OS/2, DOS or Windows machine is using codepage 850 instead of
codepage 437, you can use readmaps.dat and writmaps.dat from the "cp850"
subdirectory instead, but you should really consider switching to codepage 437.
You can find out the codepage that your are using by issueing the CHCP command.

For a Linux/Unix machine that uses ISO 8859-1 (any Unix machine
should do so!), the "readmaps.dat" file from the "latin"
subdirectory must be renamed and moved to "~/.msged.readmaps" and
the "writmaps.dat" file from the "latin" subdirectory must be
renamed and moved to "~/.msged.writmaps".  For a Linux machine that
is misconfigured and uses codepage 437 or 850, use the files from
the "ibmpc" "or "cp850" subdirectory instead.
